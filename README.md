# Introduction


**ORCS** (*Outils de RÃ©duction de Cubes Spectraux*) is an analysis engine for [SITELLE](http://www.cfht.hawaii.edu/Instruments/Sitelle) spectral cubes. With [ORCS](https://github.com/thomasorb/orcs) you can:

* extract integrated spectra
  
* fit the sinc emission lines
  
* recalibrate your data in wavelength, astrometry and flux
  
* choose between a Bayesian or a classical fitting algorithm

* and much more ...

**Examples** in Jupyter format can be found in the documentation:

http://celeste.phy.ulaval.ca/orcs-doc/examples.html
    
   
.. warning:: ORCS is always in fast development. You might see bugs or
 strange behaviours ! You might also want desperatly to have new
 features. In all cases please send an email:

## Installation


### 1. install [ORB](https://github.com/thomasorb/orb)

Follow the installation instructions [here](https://github.com/thomasorb/orb)

### 2. add orcs module

clone [ORCS](https://github.com/thomasorb/orcs)
```bash
mkdir orcs-stable # do it where you want to put orcs files
cd orcs-stable
git clone https://github.com/thomasorb/orcs.git
```

in the downloaded folder
```bash
conda activate orb # you don't need to do it if you are already in the orb environment
cd path/to/orcs-stable/orcs
python setup.py install
```

Test it:
```bash
conda activate orb # you don't need to do it if you are already in the orb environment
python -c 'import orcs.process'
```
